// Procedural MiniMap unity asset package v1.1 https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/82873;
// Made by Youcef Boukit;

How To Use : (Check the demos scens in the folder Assets/ProceduralMiniMap/Prefabs/Demos to see how it works)

1- Make a new Layer and name it for example "IconLayer",now go to your main camera and diselect "IconLayer" from the Culling Mask.
(so only the MiniMap Camera can see the icons)

2- Go to Assets/ProceduralMiniMap/Prefabs folder and drag and drop the "MiniMap Prefab" into your scene, next change the Culling Mask of
the "MiniMap Camera" to "IconLayer" only. (the layer you previously made)

3- In the "MiniMap Prefab" script, set the iconLayerNumber to the layer you made. 
(you can get its number from the layers section, see helpfull links at the end)

4-Next tweak the variables for how you like :

View Scale : how much the MiniMap Camera can see. (the height of the camera)
Icon Radius : how much distance for the icons to be considered as far.
MiniMap Scale : scale of the ui minimap. (1 is the default)
Rotate Map With Player : - true : will freeze the player_icon rotation, and the camera will rotate instead.
                         - false : will rotate the player_icon according to the player, and freeze the camera rotation. 

Icons Normal Size : the normal size of the icons in the field of view of the MiniMap Camera.
Icons Far Size : the Far size of the icons when they are out of the field of view of the MiniMap Camera. (smaller is recomended or same size)

Icons Normal Color : the normal color of the icons in the field of view of the MiniMap Camera.
Icons Far Color : the Far color of the icons when they are out of the field of view of the MiniMap Camera. (Less alpha is recomended)

Destroy Icon On Game Object Destroy : -true : the icons will be destroyed when the game object it belongs to is destroyed.

Same Size : -true : use the same size for all the icons.
            -false : use deferent sizes foreach icon. (wich can be changed in the "Game Objects" section)
Same Color : -true : use the same color for all the icons.
            -false : use deferent colors foreach icon. (wich can be changed in the "Game Objects" section)

4- Identifying the Game Objects that have icons, first choose the number of the Game Objects in the "Game Objects" size.
The Game Objects have to have a Tag assigned to them in order for the MiniMap to find them, type your game object tag in the "Tag" field,
next assign a sprite for that tag in the "Icon Sprite". (that will be the icon for all the objects that holds that tag)

5- Customize the look of your MiniMap:
In The Hierarchy Canvas/MiniMap Ui, you can change the "Background",the "Outer Texture" and the "Player Icon"
(All the demo sprites (skins) are in the 'Assets/ProceduralMiniMap/Sprites' folder)
